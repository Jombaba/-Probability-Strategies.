# -Probability-Strategies.
A presentation of a project participation in NFL 2023 big-data competition. 
The objective is to improve and focus performance of given event(s) at ensuring that, benchmark levels are sustained at a level greater than the recorede average at each implementation.
The 'Probability Strategy' is based on the probabilities of occurence of favourable events and it is best suited for certain proven situations .
If determinant factors including the knowledge of obstacles, ability to perform, the event environment are considered then, the versatility of this strategy could be exploited fully.
Though the example here is for NFL games, this basic idea applies in other areas of human endeavour where and when conditions are satisfied.
